# iogames-blocklist
Just a silly blocklist where its intended purpose is to block "most" io games and some that aren't "io" but related. Useful for applying web filtering to a campus, restricting sites on your computer lab, or just to avoid distractions.

Please, feel free to contribute to this project if you want to add more stuff! Your contribution will be highly appreciated!
